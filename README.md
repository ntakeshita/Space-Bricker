# Space-Bricker
Hello! You can play the game at http://www.ntakeshita.com/Space-Bricker. You'll need Unity Web Player to play it.

My first real game without a tutorial to hold my hand along the way. The sprites were made by me and the space background picture
was found at the URL: http://mfcreative.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/space1.jpg.

If you're interested in looking at the C# code-y type stuff you can also check that out here.
